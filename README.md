# Futures Pricing Forecasting
This repository contains the final project for STA457, focusing on forecasting cocoa futures prices using statistical (time series) and econometric modelling techniques.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze and forecast cocoa futures prices by employing econometric models. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation of forecasting performance.

## Repository Structure
- data/: Contains the dataset(s) used for analysis.

- ARDL Forecast.png: Visualization of the forecasted values using the ARDL model.

- ARDL Test.png: Visualization of the model's performance on test data.

- STA457 Final ARDL.Rmd: R Markdown file detailing the ARDL model implementation and results.

- STA457 Final Code.Rmd: R Markdown file containing the complete code for data analysis and modeling.

- STA457 Final Paper.Rmd: R Markdown file of the final report.

- STA457-Final-Paper.pdf: Compiled PDF of the final report.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- R (version 4.0 or higher)

- RStudio (recommended)

## Required R Packages
Install the necessary R packages

install.packages(c("forecast", "tseries", "urca", "ggplot2", "readr", "dplyr"))

## Running the Analysis
Clone the repository:

<pre> ```git clone https://github.com/tanya-pand3y/FuturesPricingForecasting.git``` </pre>

Open the .Rmd files in RStudio:

<pre> ```STA457 Final Code.Rmd for the complete analysis.``` </pre>

<pre> ```STA457 Final ARDL.Rmd for the ARDL model specifics.``` </pre>

Run the code chunks sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.

Results
The analysis demonstrates the application of the ARDL model in forecasting cocoa futures prices. The visualizations (ARDL Forecast.png and ARDL Test.png) illustrate the model's forecasting performance.
